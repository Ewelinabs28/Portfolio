My tester's portfolio
# Hello, it's me!
My name is Ewelina Białek-Serkis and I recently became interested in the IT industry, especially software testing. I am a Master of Business in Law, and completed postgraduate studies in Accounting. My goal was to develop technical skills and testing knowledge. On this page, I would like to share my experience, while constantly expanding the scope.
